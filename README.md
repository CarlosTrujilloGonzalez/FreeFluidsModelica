# FreeFluidsModelica
Modelica package for chemical engineering. It includes media definitions compatible with Modelica.Media.
There are several media definitions, with different capabilities. The LMedia package is fast and intended mainly for liquid applications.
The ExternalPure package is for biphasic fluids and implements multiparameter, PCSAFT with polar term, and cubic EOS for pure or pseudopure substances.
The ExternalMix package is designed mainly for VLE of mixtures, using Cubic and PCSAFT EOS. It is still in development.
The TMedia package is for fast biphasic calculations bellow the critical temperature. 
The media packages implement also the calculation of transport properties.
FreeFluids also includes steady state fluid flow models with pipes, valves, pumps and heat exchangers. And models for distillation, packaged columns, and heat exchange in agitated vessels.
