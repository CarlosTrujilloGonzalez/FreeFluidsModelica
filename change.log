Version 2.5.0
- Addition of the HeatExchangers package
- Improvements in the Pipes package, related with two phase flow and condensation.

Version 2.4.1
- Changes in LMedia and TMedia in order to be compatible with OpenModelica. Nevertheless sometimes it is necessary to use the old frontend.
- Cleanup of examples.

Version 2.4.0
- The package has been made compatible with MSL 4.0.0
- The ideal gas packages have been removed
- The ExternalMedia package has been removed due to lack of compatibility with OpenModelica.
- A new package (Columns) covering distillation and packed columns has been added.
- A new package (Instruments) with some instrumentation has been added.

Version 2.3.1
- Pressure correction has been added to the viscosity and thermal conductivity calculationin gas phase.
- A new package, called LMedia, derived from TMedia and limited to liquid phase calculation has been added.

Version 2.3.0
- TMedia package can work now over the critical temperature
- Improvement in gas density, enthalpy, and entropy calculation
- Bug correction in setState_psX function

Version 2.2.1
- Just a change in packages layout

Version 2.2.0
- Addition of packages for fluid flow.

Version 2.1.0
- Redefinition of the BaseProperties model
- Addition of derivative functions needed for the BaseProperties model operation
- Compatible with Modelica.Fluid

Version 2.0.0
- Indepth review and improvement of the Modelica code, and of the C code used in ExternalMedia. Many bug corrections also.
- Addition of Extended Corresponding States capability for viscosity and thermal conductivity calculation, using NIST polynomia when available.
- Change in the format of the structures used in ExternalMedia for substance description. The old exported structures are not compatible.
- Enlargement of the database of substances.
- The database, in MSAcces and SQLite formats, has been added to the Resources folder.
- As FreeFluidsGui project has not yet been updated, an updated Windows executable is included in the Resources folder,
in order to allow the export of substances in the formats used in the Modelica part.
 
Version 1.2.0
- Added package ExternalMedia for two phases single substance. Based in equations of state.

Version 1.1.6
- The BaseProperties model has been changed from equations to algorithms.
- Improved gas density and enthalpy calculation.
- Improved density and enthalpy derivatives calculation. 
- n-Hexane and n-Heptane added to the Fluids datadabase.

Version 1.1.5
- All media packages use now pure Modelica functions and are compatible with the new frotend of OpenModelica.
- The package TMedia has been extended to manage also the gas phase, with density and enthalpy calculation improved over ideal gas.
- The package TMedia continues being limited to work below the critical temperature.

Version 1.1.4
- Added pure Modelica functions for the calculation of physical properties by correlations, including enthalpy and entropy.
- Substitution, in the TMedium package, of the physical properties calculation using external function by a pure Modelica function calculation.
The change is not yet done for enthalpy and entropy calculation.
- Correction of some bugs in the physical properties calculation routines.
- Changed the variable name from Pc to criticalPressure in the fluids data record, in order to gain compatibility with ThermoPower.
- Addition of derivative functions calculation to the TMedium package. The package is now compatible with ThermoPower package.

Version 1.1.3
- Changed the inputChoice constant of the TMedium package from enumeration to string. It was impossible to modify the original selection.
- Changed the assertion level to warning if trying to use the saturationTemperature function, of the TMedium package, over the critical pressure. It was producing problems when working over the Pc.

Version 1.1.2
- .gitattributes file added in order to obtain correct classification of the used language.

Version 1.1.0
- The MediaData record in the MediaCommon package has been updated.
- MediaData records for more substances. Now in two files: MediaDataAL.mo and MediaDataMZ.mo, in order to better edit a high number of substances.
- The TMedia package now uses the standard way, defined in Modelica.Media.PartialTwoPhaseMedium, for substance data storage: the FluidConstants fluidConstants[] record.
- The TMedia can now use different enthalpy/entropy references: "IIR", "NBE", "ASHRAE" or  user defined.
- Pressure corrections (applicable or not, depending on the value of the constant Boolean highPressure) added for: 
	liquid enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, viscosity and thermal conductivity.
- Correction of the inverse function solver in order not to produce errors by the calculation at the critical point.
