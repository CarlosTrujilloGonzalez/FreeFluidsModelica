Version 4.7.2
- Updated version of FreeFluidsGui.exe.

Version 4.7.1
- I have gone back to the previous version of FreeFluidsGui.exe, as the last one is not working as standalone, although it works in QtCreator.

Version 4.7.0
- The cubic EOS mixing rule of Mathias-Klotz-Prausnitz(MKP) has been added to ExternalMixMedium.
- A bug in the second derivative of Theta regarding T has been solved for the MHV2 mixing rule.
