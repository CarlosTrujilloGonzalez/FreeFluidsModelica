Version 1.1.5
- All media packages use now pure Modelica functions and are compatible with the new frotend of OpenModelica.
- The package TMedia has been extended to manage also the gas phase, with density and enthalpy calculation improved over ideal gas.
- The package TMedia continues being limited to work below the critical temperature.
Version 1.1.4
- Added pure Modelica functions for the calculation of physical properties by correlations, including enthalpy and entropy.
- Substitution, in the TMedium package, of the physical properties calculation using external function by a pure Modelica function calculation.
The change is not yet done for enthalpy and entropy calculation.
- Correction of some bugs in the physical properties calculation routines.
- Changed the variable name from Pc to criticalPressure in the fluids data record.
- Addition of derivative functions calculation to the TMedium package. The package is now compatible with ThermoPower package.

Version 1.1.3
- Changed the inputChoice constant of the TMedium package from enumeration to string. It was impossible to modify the original selection.
- Changed the assertion level to warning if trying to use the saturationTemperature function, of the TMedium package, over the critical pressure. It was producing problems when working over the Pc.

Version 1.1.2
- .gitattributes file added in order to obtain correct classification of the used language.

Version 1.1.0
- The MediaData record in the MediaCommon package has been updated.
- MediaData records for more substances. Now in two files: MediaDataAL.mo and MediaDataMZ.mo, in order to better edit a high number of substances.
- The TMedia package now uses the standard way, defined in Modelica.Media.PartialTwoPhaseMedium, for substance data storage: the FluidConstants fluidConstants[] record.
- The TMedia can now use different enthalpy/entropy references: "IIR", "NBE", "ASHRAE" or  user defined.
- Pressure corrections (applicable or not, depending on the value of the constant Boolean highPressure) added for: 
	liquid enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, viscosity and thermal conductivity.
- Correction of the inverse function solver in order not to produce errors by the calculation at the critical point.
