Version 1.1.3
- Changed the inputChoice constant of the TMedium package from enumeration to string. It was impossible to modify the original selection.
- Changed the assertion level to warning if trying to use the saturationTemperature function, of the TMedium package, over the critical pressure. It was producing problems when working over the Pc.

Version 1.1.2
- .gitattributes file added in order to obtain correct classification of the used language.

Version 1.1.0
- The MediaData record in the MediaCommon package has been updated.
- MediaData records for more substances. Now in two files: MediaDataAL.mo and MediaDataMZ.mo, in order to better edit a high number of substances.
- The TMedia package now uses the standard way, defined in Modelica.Media.PartialTwoPhaseMedium, for substance data storage: the FluidConstants fluidConstants[] record.
- The TMedia can now use different enthalpy/entropy references: "IIR", "NBE", "ASHRAE" or  user defined.
- Pressure corrections (applicable or not, depending on the value of the constant Boolean highPressure) added for: 
	liquid enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, viscosity and thermal conductivity.
- Correction of the inverse function solver in order not to produce errors by the calculation at the critical point.
